# Peer-to-peer-communication
Two programs one for the server side and another for the client side. The server side will make a database file where we store records and depending on the requests from the client it will either get, insert, or delete a record. 
for the server you need to do ./dbserver [port number] for the client you need to do ./dbclient [server name] [port number]
